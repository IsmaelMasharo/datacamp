Nice! It looks like you've run 381.46 minutes in July. Because of its structure, the dimensional model usually require queries involving more than one table.
```

```
1NF: 
 - all records are unique
 - no multiple values in row column cell
2NF:
 - 1NF
 - table with one pk already 2NF
 - if more than one pk then all non pk have to be dependent of all pk
3NF:
 - satisfies 2NF
 - No transitive dependencies: non-key columns can't depend on other non-key columns
 
```
